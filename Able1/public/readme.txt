Mostly for WIN32, but also has some significant work on Linux.

I also have my sights set on porting a lot of software to 
Mac OSX, so expect to see some very real traction on that 
platform soon.

Note that this zip contains the core fastjob library only. 
The examples and demonstration tools described in the 
introduction are maintained spereately.


Projects in this directory have been built using various 
compilers and tool sets.  The list includes:

   Microsoft Visual Studio.NET
   Microsoft Visual C++ 6
   Borland C++Builder 6
   Borland Kylix
   Eclipse 3.0 / G++ (CDT)
   Eclipse 3.0 / DJGPP (CDT + a few hacks of my own)

If you have one of these tool sets, then you should be able
to easily re-create any of these projects to use the code.
Let us know if you have any trouble.
