This is a major update to the STDNOJ Namespace.

Mostly for C++98 on Windows, but also has some significant 
core-updates for POSIX.

Note that this zip contains the core support library only. 
The examples and demonstration tools described in the 
introduction are maintained spereately.

The ./Projects were built using various compilers and tool 
sets of the day. The list includes:

   Microsoft Visual Studio.NET
   Microsoft Visual C++ 6
   Borland C++Builder 6
   Borland Kylix
   Eclipse 3.0 / G++ (CDT)
   Eclipse 3.0 / DJGPP (CDT + a few hacks of my own)

You should be able to easily re-create anything here. 
Let us know if you have any trouble.
