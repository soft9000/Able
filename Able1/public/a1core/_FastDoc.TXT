.REM Directory documentation. Visit Soft9000.com.
This directory contains the core of the Standatd Noj library. 
These objects are also the most usefull, as well as the most inter-related. 
As such, they all need to be included every time you tackle a NOJ.

You will need to define your platform (WIN32, UNIX, or MSDOS) as
several source files require platform bindings. Production quality 
and complete for WIN32, but a few features are not implemented 
for UNIX and MSDOS. 

Feel free to provide and share your implementations with the rest of us!

If you want to help out by creating the test cases, that would be a good
way to master this technology, as well as to make a great contribution to 
this effort.
