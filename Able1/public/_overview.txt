FastJob Projects: A place for demonstrations, 
community Noj code, and sample project files.

Projects in this directory have been built using various 
compilers and tool sets.  The list includes:

   Microsoft Visual Studio.NET
   Microsoft Visual C++ 6
   Borland C++Builder 6
   Borland Kylix
   Eclipse 3.0 / G++ (CDT)
   Eclipse 3.0 / DJGPP (CDT + a few hacks of my own)

If you have one of these tool sets, then you should be able
to easily re-create any of these projects to use the code.
Let us know if you have any trouble.

o Projects is where we share a few fast jobs are. I have
hundreds. They will surface here as time allows. 
Feel free to submit yours!
