This NOJ was written to allows me to read, bookmark,
and extract quotations from text files. Just like a
book.

"Just like a book" means that text is formatted into
pages. Pages that allow us to track reading progress, 
as well as to exchange book references with others.

Why Bother?
-----------
Because we use everything from desktops to PDAs 
(-that span 20 years of technology - HP 100/200LX, 
Zaurus 5600,Jornada 720...) the reader is designed 
to work using plain old ASCII - no kerned fonts, no 
graphical support - deleciously cheesy!

Because WIN32 is very popular, a graphical interface
is included. Because console applications are more 
portable (especially when you have a DOS emulator), 
a DOS reading utility is also provided.

Whats Next?
-----------
I will be converting hundreds of public domain tomes 
and electronic texts for us to read. If you are a 
civic minded sort of person, then you can share the
cheesy books that you create with this program 
family, too.
