This NOJ was written to get around an annoying 
problem - calling explorer from the WIN32 command-line
was somehow disabled on my machine! 

I cobbled this together quickly to get around the hassle
when needing to "explore" a folder or URL quickly.

This NOJ also works as a neat little way to load a 
program from AUTOEXE.INF on a CD-ROM - Just add 
something like-

UOPEN=\MYPATH\MYFILE.HTML

... after ...

[autoexec]
open="UOPEN.EXE"


-In you AUTOEXEC.INF


Enjoy!
