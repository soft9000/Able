We all have bills to pay. We all have the same number 
of hours in the day. Your donations will allow us to 
divert time away from our family, friends, and full-time 
jobs to add exciting new features to this project.

Of course, this means that the future of the Neat Odd 
Job Project is totally in your hands... So be it a 
single dollar or fifty, consider contributing today 
- Become a reason for your success, as well as the 
success of the Open Source Movement. 

After all, if you spent countless volunteer hours 
working on a free project, wouldn't donations be 
one of the things that you would like to see? It 
is the capitalistic way of saying "thank you"!

May the source be with you... Always.
