This is the main include point for the Able Namespace. 

Because platform files are referenced by many of the
files in the noj folder (e.g. <unix/unix_FileInformation.cpp>),
this folder should be included in your path. 

You will need to #define a manifest constant for your platform 
(UNIX, MSDOS, WIN32), as well as to add the "using namespace Able1"
whenever including <Able1.hpp>

If you want to help out by creating the test cases, that would be 
a good way to explore this technology, as well as to make a great 
contribution to this effort.

Thanks, & enjoy!
