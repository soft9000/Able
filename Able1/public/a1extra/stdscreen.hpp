// 05/04/2005: Namespace created to handle standard screen operations.
//
// Cognitive extractions from my ctoos[portable text], omniwind[WIN32 API], 
// and WinCon01[WIN32 Console] projects - As well as my Unix Curses and Carbon
// meanderings -
//
// The goal is to have a single, platform-independent GUI and TUI edit / control
// set that hosts a Java::SWT-style commitment to platform operation on DOS, WIN32, 
// Linux / Unix (CURSES / NCURSES /PC CURSES) and Mac (Carbon on OSX).
// 
// I have much of it Ready - I just need some time to combine the models, port them,
// and test it all on each of the above platforms.
//
// Contact me if you are interested in it and I will make it a higher priority
// in my life. Better still, if you are comfortable with coding and UML, then 
// perhaps we can crack this nut together. The experience would make a great 
// book!
//
// Thanks,
//   R. Nagy
