As a parsing framework, this class is designed to parse tag 
laden data. 

The parsing frameworks is solid enough to use for a design 
pattern for generic parsing of just about any tagged 
convention (INI files, HP or Honeywell monitored device 
databases, etc.)

As an XML parser, it hosts an event model. Unlike SAX or DOM, 
this model is level based. Newer innovations (like the pathing
concepts of XPATH) could easily be added to augment this level 
parsing concept, but the framework probably does not need to
be changed.

I have several other parsing frameworks available. Feel free 
to contact me if you want to geek out...
