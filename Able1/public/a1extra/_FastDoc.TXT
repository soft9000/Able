.REM Directory documentation. Visit Soft9000.com.
DOCUMENTATION: Every interesting project needs a place to
put things before they become official...

In general, this directory contains some very helpful 
classes. Some that could even be demonstrated by a few 
interesting neat odd-job drivers (as in 
../projects/noj_010_EzLog.)

WARNING - While some classes are ancient, the models here 
are still very much works in progress. As such, they are 
more prone to refactoring than those located outside of 
this directory.
