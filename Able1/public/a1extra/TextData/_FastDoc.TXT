.REM Directory documentation.

This is a place to store common text reading, writing, 
and manipulation routines. Expect classes here to read
and otherwise manage data from CSV, TAB, SDF, HTML, XML, 
and other common data representations. 

Mostly 7 bit, ASCII-laden data. Data are commonly 
imported and exported as arrays of fastjob strings.
